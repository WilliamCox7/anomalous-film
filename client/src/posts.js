      is not to suggest movies or TV shows to the reader but to instead, promote film's best. If you have not 
      seen it, I would HIGHLY recommend you move on to my next post. The best way to appreciate a good film is 
      by actually watching it (wow that's insightful).`

        for example, can contribute to a viewer's experience through abstract movement from the camera. Editing 
        can cause shifts in time to feel natural. Production design can manipulate the viewer to be sympathetic 
    	to the film's context. There are truly endless ways that a film can influence it's subjects.`

        virtual reality. Anything can be staged because the growth in our technology and talent isn't stopping 
        anytime soon. But there are limitations. While filmmakers have a endless library of stories to tell, they 
        have to worry about something called time-management. A typical problem is that there is just to much to 
        tell for a two hour period of time. To remedy this, we fast-forward time to the most important events. 
        We break the story into bits and pieces and put them together to create a sequence of mini-stories. We 
        call these 'scenes'.`
